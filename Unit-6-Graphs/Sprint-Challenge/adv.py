PLANNING:
    - Player always starts at room 0
    - Goal: player musttravel every room at least once and find shortest path (BFS?)
    - start at 0, select random unexplored, keep track of graph AND path
    - repeat until you hit none unexplored, then return the same way you came
    - look for more unexplored
    - when graph reaches 500 entries, player is done 

Useful commands: 
    -`player.current_room.id`
    -`player.current_room.get_exits()`
    -`player.travel(direction)`
